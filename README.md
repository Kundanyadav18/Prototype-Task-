# Failure Prediction Prototype

- Predicts equipment failure from time-series sensor data
- Used a dummy dataset of 100 time steps with simulated sensor readings
- Trained a Decision Tree Classifier
- Achieved 80% accuracy on test data
- Limitation: the model fails to detect the rare failure class due to class imbalance
